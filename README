Supply Chain: Inefficient and Error-Prone Yard Management

Problem statement
Inefficiencies in yard management can lead to delays, increased operational costs, and lower overall productivity. Traditional methods often rely on manual processes, which are prone to errors and lack real-time visibility. This can result in trailers being misplaced, underutilized, or causing congestion, leading to a constraint in the supply chain.
